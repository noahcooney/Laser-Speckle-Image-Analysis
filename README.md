# Laser Speckle Image Analysis

This repository contains code, data, and analysis for **quantifying peripheral perfusion** using laser speckle contrast imaging (LSCI). This project explores how blood flow responds to physiologic and experimental challenges.

## Contents

- 📓 **Notebooks/** — Jupyter notebooks for processing and analyzing speckle images  
- 📁 **Data/** — Sample images and group-collected experimental results  
- 🧪 **Scripts/** — Python tools for speckle contrast calculation, ROI selection, and plotting  
- 📄 **Reports/** — Results summaries and annotated figures for each experimental section  

## Features

- Calculation of speckle contrast (κ) and LSFI for flow quantification  
- Region of interest (ROI) analysis to isolate physiological signals  
- Visualization of perfusion changes in:
  - Breath-hold vasoconstriction
  - Cuff-induced blood flow occlusion
  - Phantom flow validation  
- Statistical comparison of perfusion under varying conditions
